# matrimonial
Repository Description: A matrimonial application built with Spring Boot and Next.js, allowing users to register, manage profiles, and search for potential matches.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### Backend (Spring Boot):

Set up a new Spring Boot project:

Create a new directory for your backend project.
Open your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) and create a new Maven or Gradle project.
Add the necessary dependencies to your build file. For Maven, add the required dependencies for Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL Connector/J.
Configure the database connection:

In the application.properties/application.yml file, specify the database connection details such as URL, username, password, and driver.
Create the necessary Java classes:

Create model classes for User, Profile, Preferences, etc., representing the entities in your matrimonial application.
Implement repositories to handle database operations. Use Spring Data JPA to simplify database interactions.
Create services to encapsulate the business logic and handle operations related to user registration, profile management, etc.
Implement controllers to handle HTTP requests and responses. Map the endpoints to the appropriate service methods.
Implement the necessary APIs:

Define REST endpoints in the controllers for user registration, profile management, search functionality, etc.
Map the endpoints to the corresponding service methods.
Implement validation, error handling, and authentication/authorization as needed.
Frontend (Next.js):

### Set up a new Next.js project:

Create a new directory for your frontend project.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Initialize a new Next.js project using the command npx create-next-app.
Create the necessary components:

Create pages for different sections of the matrimonial application, such as registration, user profiles, search, etc.
Define layouts or templates to maintain a consistent page structure.
Create reusable UI components like forms, buttons, cards, etc.
Implement the necessary functionality:

Connect to the backend APIs using Axios or Fetch API to perform CRUD operations and retrieve data.
Implement form handling, data validation, and error handling on the frontend.
Design the user interface using HTML, CSS, and any additional styling frameworks or libraries you prefer.
